                <p>Apart from being a Full-Stack Developer, I love staying active and spending time outdoors. I enjoy playing basketball, volleyball, and skiing, as well as riding motorcycles—I am interested in watching motorcycle repair videos.</p>
                <p className="mb-0">On a fun note, even though I’m right-handed, I somehow play football exclusively with my left foot—a talent that even I don’t fully understand!</p>
